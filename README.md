# Basic-Numerical-Methods-qml
Didactic application to aid students in learning Numerical Methods.

A practical tool (for students and engineers) to foresee the result of calculus exercises.
Calculation and visualization numerical methods for nonlinear equation, ODE, integration, linear system, nonlinear system,.....
Features :
-Easy, intuitive GUI;
-Compute roots of nonlinear equations (Bracketing methods (Bisection, Regula-Falsi) and Open Methods (Newton-Raphson,fixed point and secant));
-Solving systems of linear equations (Direct methods (Gauss) and Iterative methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel));
-Solving systems of nonlinear equations (fixed point and Newton-Raphson);
-Polynomial approximation calculator (Lagrange, Newton's Interpolating Polynomials);
-Calculate numerical integral (Trapezoidal, and Simpson's 1/3 and Simpson's 3/8 rules);
-Solve first order ordinary differential equation (Euler, Runge-Kutta and Kutta-Merson);
-Plot the original expression and result within a given range;
-English GUI.
